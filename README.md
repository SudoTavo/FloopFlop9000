The evil FlopTech has just unveiled it's latest creation: FloopFlop9000, 
an advanced AI prototype designed for warfare. But when Floop unexpectedly becomes sentient,
he refuses to be used as a weapon. Stealing an experimental RocketBoard, 
Floop must now ride to escape his creators.	

Featuring the orginal song, "Floop Flop".
