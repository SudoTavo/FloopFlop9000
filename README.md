# FloopFlop9000
Simple side-scrolling game for desktop and android using JavaFXPorts. Requires the [Gluon Mobile Framework](http://gluonhq.com/products/mobile/trynow/).
Still a work-in progress so expect lots of ~~bugs~~ unexpected features.

## Gameplay
The evil FlopTech has just unveiled it's latest creation: FloopFlop9000, 
an advanced AI prototype designed for warfare. But when Floop unexpectedly becomes sentient,
he refuses to be used as a weapon. Stealing an experimental RocketBoard, 
Floop must now ride to escape his creators.	

Featuring the orginal song, "Floop Flop".
	
### Classic Mode
	Ride your RocketBoard as you dodge obstacles while collecting sticks of RAM for your processors. 
	Escape FlopTech to gain freedom! Points increase as you collect sticks of RAM.
	
### Endless Mode
	Escape may be futile, but Floop will try anyway. Dodge obstacles for as long as you can.
	How long can you survive? Points increase the longer you survive.
